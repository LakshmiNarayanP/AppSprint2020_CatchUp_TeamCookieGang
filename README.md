## IDEA or PROBLEM STATEMENT
Catch Up is a thooughts and ideas centric app trying to provode the best experience. Expressing oneself in their purest form and connecting others with those thoughts is one of the key elements of a microblogging application. We have tried to translate that into our app. The user can refresh their daily feeds with some amazing and well crafted content from their fellow users. It could be a small blog post of a story that one would like to share or an experience that one might want another to experience through their magical build of words and vocabulary or maybe an train of emotions through a unique voice message combined with a wonderful 3D avatar of yourself speaking those words or maybe a scenic photograph that you once captured or a joyous moment that you want to share on a video, all of this on one app - Catch Up ! Cathc Up brings you the latest blogs and posts following the latest trend. If the user is interested, they can perhaps filter what they see. 
Catch Up is guaranteed to fill you with knowledge and emotions every time you browse through and makes every minute spent on the app a wonderful one.
